    "[Biopython](https://biopython.org/) is a large and heterogenous Python library that supports several common bioinformatics tasks, including sequence I/O, access to the main online databases, sequence alignment, motif construction and search, the analysis of phenotypic data, and some machine learning algorithms. It is the alternative to [BioPerl](https://bioperl.org/) in the Python world.\n",

    "A detailed treatment of Biopython is beyond the scope of this module. This notebook highlights the points of contact between the design and functioning of Biopython and the concepts we have covered so far; the aim is to give you a few entry points and to convince you that you now have all the knowledge and tools required to learn the relevant parts of the library and apply them to your specific problems, when need arises."

    "Biopython is an object oriented library. The [class diagram](https://biopython.org/DIST/docs/api/class-tree.html) is extensive. It describes the inheritance relation between all classes in the library. However it is best used as a reference, and is not a good access point for learning the library. The reason is that, as we will see, the most important relation between objects for an understanding of Biopython is the *has-a* relationship (e.g., a Sequence Record object has an attribute that is a Sequence object) rather than the *is-a* relationship of inheritance. The [tutorial](http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.html) is a far more accessible entry point, and I recommend that you have a look. This sampler discusses a few examples from the tutorial, without any pretense at completeness."

    "# Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explores only a small fraction of the functionality offered by Biopython. From this quick overview, a few facts should be clear:\n",
    "* Biopython constructs follow general Python coding practices and generally behave the way you would expect them to do;\n",
    "* Biopython objects are interoperable with standard Python data types;\n",
    "* the representation offered by Biopython is both flexible and powerful;\n",
    "* unavoidably, there is a certain overhead involved in using it;\n",
    "* and finally, there is a learning curve, but given a general knowledge of the language, it isn't a steep one.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for all libraries, the benefit of using it should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Whether for instance you are better off using the \"blast-xml\" parser or writing some simple code to parse the \"csv\" output of a BLAST search largely depends on what information you need and what you want to do with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In my opinion, it is certainly worth knowing in general what the library has to offer. There may not, however, be much point in trying to learn the function of all of its classes for the sake of it - that time is better spent in improving one's general programming proficiency. One should probably learn how to use the appropriate parts of Biopython in a task-oriented way, as required by specific problems. "
