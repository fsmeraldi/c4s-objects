Move the ```makeSound``` code to the class ```Animal```, and modify it so that it uses the ```sound``` attribute to print the correct sound. Remove ```makeSound``` from the derived classes.

You could then derive two classes, say ```DNASequence``` and ```ProteinSequence```, with specific functions - for instance statistics on aminoacid/nucleotide usage, translation, etc. Your code can even transparently invoke command line utilities such as BLAST, CLUSTALW, etc using the ```subprocess``` module, see the [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html)\n",
